# Upgrading the business plan

## Purchase a plan

You can send the deal’s slug to this endpoint (containing the business slug in the URL), to upgrade the plan. The response will contain a payment link to which you should redirect the user.

**Note** Users can’t upgrade their business to a lower plan than what they already have. If they try to do, this endpoint will raise an error.

**Note** If users try to upgrade their plan to a deal that has fewer available seats than they already use, they will face an error. For example, if their workspace has 5 members, and they want to upgrade to a plan that has 3 seats, the system will throw them an error. They should either choose a deal with 5+ seats or remove some members from their workspace first.

### Example

```json
// **Request**
https://api.formaloo.net/v2.0/businesses/{business_slug}/ (POST)
{
    "plan_deal": "{plan_deal_slug}"
}

// **Response**
{
    "status": 201,
    "errors": {
        "general_errors": [],
        "form_errors": {}
    },
    "data": {
        "business_plan": {
            "plan_deal": "6Mh4Grg7",
            "link": "https://accounts.formalo.net/v1/payment/zarrinpal/process/?transaction_code=1580770372"
        }
    }
}
```

### Example (Errors)

```json
// **Response: Error on downgrading plan**
{
    "status": 400,
    "errors": {
        "general_errors": [
            [
                "Cant upgrade to lower plan!"
            ]
        ],
        "form_errors": {}
    },
    "data": {}
}

// **Response: Error on workspace seats**
{
    "status": 400,
    "errors": {
        "general_errors": [
            [
                "This plan deal allows 0 members and invitations. However, your workspace currently has 2 members and or invitations. You have to remove some members to be able to buy this plan."
            ]
        ],
        "form_errors": {}
    },
    "data": {}
}
```



## Purchase plan with coupon

In the process of buying a plan, you can pass the `coupon_code` to apply it to the user’s purchase. If the coupon code is invalid or does not apply to the purchase, the server will return an `HTTP 400` error with proper messages. Otherwise, it will be applied to the purchase.

### Example

```json
**// Request**
https://api.formaloo.net/v2.0/businesses/{business_slug}/plans/ (POST)
{
    "plan_deal": "{plan_deal_slug}",
    "coupon_code": "{coupon_code}"
}

**//Response**
{
    "status": 201,
    "errors": {
        "general_errors": [],
        "form_errors": {}
    },
    "data": {
        "business_plan": {
            "plan_deal": "{plan_deal_slug}",
            "coupon": "{coupon_code}",
            "link": "https://accounts.formaloo.net/v1/payment/paypal/?transaction_code=3600886651"
        }
    }
}
```

### Example (error)

```json
**// Request**
https://api.formaloo.net/v2.0/businesses/{business_slug}/plans/ (POST)
{
    "plan_deal": "{plan_deal_slug}",
    "coupon_code": "{coupon_code}"
}

**//Response**
{
    "status": 400,
    "errors": {
        "general_errors": [
            [
                "Coupon code is not valid for your purchase!"
            ]
        ],
        "form_errors": {}
    },
    "data": {}
}
```

## Purchasing plan subscriptions

In order to purchase a plan subscription, you follow the same flow as buying a normal plan. You send the plan deal's slug to the server, and redirect the user to the payment link returned from the server.
