# Business (Workspace)

Use to get a business's data using it's identifier (`business_identifier`).

## Reading the current business plan

If you read a business’s data from ICAS, you can see the currently active plan deal along with the business data.

**Fields:** This endpoint gives you a business that you have access to. This data may include various fields:'

- `access_level`: Your access level on the business, which can be:
  - `owner` This belongs to you and you have full access to it.
  - `admin` For future purposes, won’t be returned for now.
  - `team_member` Read-only access to business. You can’t edit the business, and can’t see or edit its members and invitations.
